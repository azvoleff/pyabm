pyabm - an agent-based modeling toolkit for Python 2.7.x.
 
Description
_______________________________________________________________________________

'pyabm' is an agent-based modeling toolkit written to simplify coding and 
running agent-based models in the Python programming language. pyabm includes 
tools to output model results (as text files, plots or ESRI shapefiles), and 
has a parameter handling system to ease the process of model testing and 
validation, and of running multiple scenarios with varying model parameters.

The toolkit was constructed by Alex Zvoleff as part of his dissertation 
research at San Diego State University (SDSU) in the Department of Geography.  
Contact Alex Zvoleff or Prof. Li An at SDSU with any questions.

pyabm is still a work in progress - while the toolkit is functional in its 
present form, changes that will be made in the near future may not be backward 
compatible with existing code. Contact Alex Zvoleff or see the `pyabm website 
<http://www.azvoleff.com/research/pyabm>`_ for more details.  A Python 3 
compatible version of pyabm is in the works, and should be released by summer 
2013.

See the `pyabm website <http://www.azvoleff.com/research/pyabm>`_ for more 
information, past releases, publications, and recent presentations.
